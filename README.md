# Parley-v2

This is a networked communication application built in Java, designed to support real-time text messaging, peer-to-peer (P2P) file transfers and video streaming between clients, and online turn based games such as Blackjack. It uses a central server for message relaying, user coordination, and peer discovery enabling direct communication between clients for media exchange.

The chat server supports multiple clients by using Javaâ€™s multithreading, with each client handled in its own thread. Messages are added to a shared, thread-safe queue and processed separately, decoupling communication and improving scalability and responsiveness.

The base of the project was a group project for CS313, however I decided to take it a step further by expanding the scope of the project, improving code quality, enhancing client/server messenging lifecycle and adding game lobbies like Blackjack.
